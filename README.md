# crud-api-golang-grpc
Message-based RPC API built with Go, gRPC, rabbitMQ, and MongoDB

# Summary
Simple test API I built to do a couple things:
  - experiment with event-driven backend architectures
    - use Remote Procedure Call to handle user interactions and to complete requests that require a data response (Creates, Reads)
    - use a message queue to handle producing/consuming of events that do not require a response (Updates, Deletes)
  - learn and implement new technologies (GoLang, gRPC, rabbitMQ)
