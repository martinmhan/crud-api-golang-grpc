# crud-api-golang-grpc
Message-based RPC API built with Go, gRPC, rabbitMQ, and MongoDB

# Summary
Simple test API I built to do a couple things:
  1) experiment with event-driven backend architectures
     - use Remote Procedure Call for direct user interactions
     - use a message queue to handle producing/consuming of actual "work" (in this case, CRUD DB operations)
  2) learn new technologies (GoLang, gRPC, rabbitMQ)
